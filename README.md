Projects are from different diffculty level -some are basic and some are advanced

I am trying to display comments in files to uderstand code clearly.

### Project1: Movies CRUD API:
In this project, there is a single main.go files in which all crud operations were done with the help of taking an example of movies.
Tou can create new movie, update existing movie, access all movies, get movie by id and delete a movie.
